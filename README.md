# notie.

*so this is where boredom gets us.* Notie is a note-taking mobile-first application written completely in Svelte with  
Capacitor.js, this was originally named "AreaTwo Notie" but was renamed as simply Notie. It has a user interface similar 
to Google Keep Notes, but is completely offline.
